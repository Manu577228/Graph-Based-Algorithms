# An Eulerian Path is a trail in a graph that visits every edge exactly once.
# An Eulerian Circuit (or Cycle) is an Eulerian Path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

# Explanation

# In graph theory, Eulerian paths and circuits are used to determine whether a given 
# graph can be traversed without repeating edges.

# A graph has an Eulerian Circuit if all vertices have even degree.

# A graph has an Eulerian Path but not a Circuit if exactly two vertices have odd degree.

# Otherwise, it has neither.

# We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Hierholzerâ€™s Algorithm to find such a path or circuit efficiently.

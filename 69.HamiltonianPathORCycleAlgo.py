# A Hamiltonian Path in a graph is a path that visits every vertex exactly once.
# A Hamiltonian Cycle (or Circuit) is a Hamiltonian Path that 
# starts and ends at the same vertex, forming a cycle.

# Explanation

# The Hamiltonian Path Problem is a classic NP-complete problem in graph theory.
# The goal is to determine whether such a path or cycle exists in a given graph.

# In Hamiltonian Path, we just need to visit all vertices once.

# In Hamiltonian Cycle, we must also return to the starting vertex.

# Since the problem is NP-complete, no polynomial-time solution exists for general graphs.
# Hence, we usually solve it using Backtracking â€” trying all 
# possible paths and checking if one satisfies the conditions.

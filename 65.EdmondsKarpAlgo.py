# The Edmonds-Karp Algorithm is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method to compute 
# the maximum flow in a flow network.
# It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest augmenting path in terms of the number of edges.

# Explanation:

# In a flow network, the goal is to push as much flow as possible from a source node S to a sink node T.

# Ford-Fulkerson works by repeatedly finding augmenting paths and increasing the flow along them.

# Edmonds-Karp specifically uses BFS to always find the shortest path (fewest edges) from S to T.

# The BFS approach ensures the algorithm runs in O(V * EÂ²) time, where V is the number of 
# vertices and E is the number of edges.

# Steps:

# Initialize flow in all edges to 0.

# While there exists a path from source to sink in the residual graph (found via BFS):

# Find the minimum capacity along this path.

# Augment the flow along the path by this minimum capacity.

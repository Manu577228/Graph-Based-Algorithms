# Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure used to efficiently 
# manage a collection of disjoint sets, supporting union and find operations. 
# Path Compression optimizes the find operation by flattening 
# the structure of the tree, making future queries faster.

# Explanation:

# DSU Basics:
# DSU maintains sets where each set has a representative (or parent).

# find(x): Returns the representative of the set containing x.

# union(x, y): Merges the sets containing x and y.

# Path Compression:
# While finding the parent of an element, we update the parent of every 
# visited node to point directly to the root. This reduces the tree height and 
# makes subsequent find operations nearly constant time.

# Use Case:
# DSU is widely used in algorithms involving connectivity, like Kruskalâ€™s 
# Minimum Spanning Tree, detecting cycles in graphs, and network connectivity queries.
